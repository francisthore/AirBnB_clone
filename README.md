This is our first part of the AirBnB clone project. We will
be building a console in python which will handle the CRUD process
of the application.

How do you start the app?
-> Run the console.py module in terminal

How do you use it?
-> To create an instance you type <create> <ClassName>
-> To show an instance you type <show> <ClassName> <id>
-> To delete an instance you type <destroy> <ClassName> <id>
-> To list all instances you type <all> or <all> <ClassName>
-> To update you type <update> <ClassName> <id> <attr> <value>

Examples:
create BaseModel
